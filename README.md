I started by creating a dictionary called my_info to store your personal details using key-value pairs, where each key (e.g., "Names", "Email", "Hobby") serves as a label, and the corresponding value holds the actual information. I then populated this dictionary with details such as your name, Slack username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred programming language. To display the stored information in a structured and readable format, I used a multi-line f-string, allowing you to dynamically insert values from the dictionary into the printed text. This approach makes the output visually appealing and ensures that all key-value pairs are neatly displayed in a single print statement.
