I started by creating a dictionary called personal_profile to store all your profile details using key-value pairs, where each key (e.g., "name", "email", "hobby") acts as a label, and the corresponding value holds the actual information. I then populated this dictionary with details such as your name, Slack username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred programming language. To display the information neatly, I used print statements along with f-strings, which allowed me to dynamically insert values from the dictionary into the printed text. For instance, print(f"Name: {personal_profile['name']}") extracts the value linked to the "name" key and displays it in a structured format. My approach involved efficiently organizing profile data in a dictionary and using formatted strings to present it clearly.
